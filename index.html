    <h4 class="gradient">Eart is where we live.</h4>
      <p>Land makes up only about 30 percent of the planet and we live on that 
          30 percent. Yet most environmental issues come from us who live in that 30 percent. Furthermore, 
          not everyone living in that 30 percent contributes equally. A recently published report identified
           that 100 energy companies have been responsible for 71% of all industrial emissions since human-driven 
           climate change was officially recognized. And it’s not just the energy sector, the top 15 U.S. food
            and beverage companies generate nearly 630 million metric tons of greenhouse gases every year.(1) 
            “Human use, population and technology have reached that certain stage where Mother Earth no longer 
            accepts our presence with silence” as Dalai Lama quotes. This is a sign. It is not right. 
            Earth is dirty. Earth is polluted and Earth is dying. We need to change and we need to do it now. 
            Sustainability Practice is one of the ways to heal our planet. It enriches our life quality, improves 
            our ecosystem and creates/preserves natural resources for the future generations. By practicing sustainability, 
            we make sure that we make better choices and ethical ones that bring forward a safe and better quality of life for 
            everyone in the future. This is for our own survival. If we deplete the natural resources of our planet, future 
            generations will also be depleted.</p>

        <h3>Corporate World</h3>
        <p>In the corporate world, a lot of companies and organizations are taking the sustainability 
              holistic approach by monitoring the manufacturing process to logistics to branding to marketing 
              to advertising strategies and lastly to consumers. They have to. Most sustainability problems and 
              environmental issues came from the manufacturing of products and its after use or waste. Corporates 
              are at the root of the problem(or closer to the root). For companies to shift towards a green solution 
              and sustainability is beneficial to both the company and the environment. Sustainable business practices 
              model lead to a significant decreased energy costs in the long-term. Some quick actions like switching 
              to energy-efficient lighting reduce long-term electrical costs or using clean energy like solar and wind energy, 
              along with energy-efficient equipment, reduces monthly utility bills. It is a positive thing for companies. 
              It helps them to become more efficient overall. Spreading and Encouraging the conservation of natural resources 
              is a reflection not only of your company values and brand, but also employees and the working environment. 
              When companies prioritize sustainability in their business, They are bridging a deeply important conversation 
              to the forefront of consumerism. The societal impact can be reached far and wide. Regardless of how beneficial 
              it is for companies to have a sustainability approach,</p>

      <p>Some example of strategy that I think works well is with what Fuseproject and Pelacase is doing 
          (where Fuseproject is the design studio where they are social responsible in their design and 
          Pelacase is a start up company whose identity is based on being sustainable and environmentally 
          friendly) which I'll explore more in this essay. This is happening because the CEO and the boards 
          are not in sync or engaged with sustainable practice. It is a problem we mostly see in big companies 
          but what about smaller venues whose entity is based on sustainability? “Nielsen studies show that 66% 
          of consumers would spend more for a product if it came from a sustainable brand, and 81% of global consumers 
          feel strongly that companies should help improve the environment.”(2) This proves that having a 
          sustainability approach to their strategies is beneficial to companies. It is a changing trend 
          towards supporting the environment among millennial consumers which are the largest generation of 
          population as of right now and it is only getting more and more important as the number of millennials 
          and Gen-Z grows. It is an expectation from consumers of companies and organizations to be more 
          responsible and transparent in the way they make their products and operate. There are shifting 
          towards holistic designs and more responsibility for the material use. Professional communications, 
          good products and good intentions are simply no longer enough. In PwC’s June 2021 Global Consumer 
          Insights Pulse Survey, half of all global consumers surveyed say they’ve become even more 
          eco-friendly —for example, 66% of consumers (73% of millennials) worldwide report being willing to 
          pay extra for sustainable offerings.(5) Sustainability is not an ultimate endpoint, but instead 
          it is an on-going process of learning and adaptation. If brands do not grow, they will simply become 
          irrelevant.</p>

      <p class="part3-quote"> “Designers have the potential to act as transdisciplinary integrators and facilitators.” </p>
      <div class="part3-text">
      <p>No matter who we are, where we live, and what we do, we all are responsible for our activities and 
          our actions. We have a moral obligation to each other species, our generations in the future and 
          each other to sustain our Earth. Now what about us, as designers of the world, we are the middle 
          ground between the corporate world and consumers world. We are part of the process. We are morally 
          obligated to become better and more responsible to the environment. Designing for sustainability 
          requires a redesign of our usual habits, practice, lifestyle and the way we think about design.
           According to D.C. Wahl wrote in Medium, “Designers have the potential to act as transdisciplinary 
           integrators and facilitators.”(3) The change in why we design things affects what and how we design. 
           We have an opportunity to insert and infuse sustainability into consumer’s lives through the products 
           and visual designs, from product design to graphic design. Nevertheless, all communities require a 
           widespread participation in approaching sustainability. From local to regional and global, we, 
           humanity, are to engage collectively in cooperative ways that will transform design visions into 
           reality.</p>

      <h3>My Practice</h3>
    </div>

      <div class="right">
      <p>	As for my practice, I grew up with a family who is really hands-on and tactile. From a father 
          who works in forming jewelry and a mother who is obsessed with knitting and home-made anything 
          fabric, was born me, with a deep passion for origami. My mother always encourages me to be hands 
          on and creative. From a boy with a love for folding paper, to becoming a graphic designer, that 
          passion of mine developed into a love for packaging. I have been training as a graphic designer for 
          the past 7 years since my undergraduate to now in a graduate program. Graphic design, especially 
          branding and packaging has infused into my everyday life. I always look for new innovative things 
          other designers are doing with branding and packaging design. I am always fascinated by new innovation 
          in which designers find a better way to create products, materials or packaging that is more 
          environmentally-friendly. Sustainability was not something I considered a lot about during my 
          undergraduate study. But as I’m growing up, I saw the rise in an awareness of environmental issues 
          and it made me wonder what I can do to help or participate. I have very little experience in 
          designing for sustainability and it is something that I want to learn more about. Outside of my 
          design work, I myself practise sustainability as much as I can in order to help and be more 
          responsible like being cautious of my packages’ waste and if I can recycle them as well as I always 
          pick the more sustainable option if the opportunity itself presents. I do think that individual 
          practise is not enough for this to change. It’s everyone’s responsibility from the Government to 
          corporations to individuals. When I say Government or corporation’s responsibility, I mean the way 
          they operate. I have heard people back in Thailand and even my relatives say that “it’s okay, we 
          are not going to make any difference compared to the corporate” so they do not care about being more 
          environmentally responsible. It always makes me feel frustrated. Even though I said that individuals 
          are not enough to change, unlike my relatives, I do think no matter the background you came from or 
          where you live, sustainability is a world-wide topic so we all should contribute. Corporations and 
          Governments are made of individuals like us.</p>

      <p>One of Fuseproject's accomplishments is a collaboration with a famous furniture design company 
          like Herman Miller to create the Sayl chair. The design of the chair uses fewer parts which 
          mean less materials but at the same time maintain healthy support and overall the design is 
          really clean. Overall the Sayl Chair  sets the reference point in its class for quality, 
          performance, design and most importantly, it’s responsible design, safer for the environment. 
          The design of the chair Inspired by suspension bridges. The structures use the least material. 
          Yves Béhar applied his knowledge in industrial engineering to create an amazing structures of 
          Sayl Chair. The Eco-Dematerialized design of the work chair uses less material in a more 
          inventive way. At the time of the launch, Béhar stated: "Attainability can only be reached if 
          every molecule in the product is working harder. Fewer parts and less material ultimately mean 
          less cost and less carbon footprint."(4) Béhar created a product that was 93% recyclable, and 
          cheaper than similar products in the Herman Miller range. The manufacture of this chair is on 3 
          continents which reduce the distance between the factory and the buyer which also means less 
          carbon footprint. The Sayl Chair contains no PVCs and its materials are almost entirely recyclable.

      <p>Fuse Project also worked with Puma to create a shoe box called “Clever Little Bag”, 
          a recyclable heat-woven bag and a flat-pack cardboard tray to replace the shoebox.</p>
      <p> Fuse Project says: “The bag uses 65% less cardboard than the standard shoe box, has no laminated 
        printing, no tissue paper, takes up less space and weighs less in shipping. The tens of millions 
        of shoes shipped in our bag will reduce water, energy and diesel consumption on the manufacturing 
        level alone by more than 60% per year.”(4) This results in saving about 8,500 tons of papers used, 
        20m megajoules of electricity, 1m litres of fuel oil and 1m litres of water over the course of a year, 
        simply by rethinking the packaging.</p>

      <h3>Pelacase,<br> the case study</h3>

      <div class="part6-text">
      <p>	Pelacase whose identity is based on being sustainable are a great example of newer companies that 
          speak to a new generation of consumers. Pelacase is using compostable “flaxstic” which is a plastic-like 
          material made out of flaxseed, to make stylish cell phone cases. The cases are not only eco-friendly, 
          they’re actually beautiful, durable and high quality. When we think of plastic used, we often think of 
          plastic bags and other types of plastic like straw but rarely phone cases. According to Pelacase study, 
          1.5 billion phone cases are thrown away each year and that’s a lot of plastic waste. Another study in 2017 
          from statista found that 79% of phone users use a protective case for their smartphone. As time goes by, 
          more and more people use smartphones. We all want to protect our smartphone from scratches, wear and tear 
          and the dreaded drop. But, what do we do with old phone cases when we upgrade our device or even change our 
          cases? The question of how to recycle phone cases is a hot topic, considering less than 5% of all plastic gets 
          recycled and the rest ends up in landfills. It can take up to 1000 years for plastic to break down, but that 
          doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. Plastic breaks down into micro-plastics that end up floating in the ocean. </p>

        <p>Pelacase not only have compostable phone cases and other flaxstic products, they also have a recycle system 
        where they help their customers recycle used Pelacase. This is a smart business strategy. It’s a win-win situation 
        for both Pelacase and its consumers. Pelacase is making saving the planet more human-level and accessible to consumers. 
        Not only did they appear as a good and responsible company, they also saved the cost of producing new flaxstic by recycling 
        their old products. Pelacase has sold over a million cases to date, which equates to 587,280 pounds of plastic 
        that was prevented from entering the waste stream, based on the average conventional plastic case and packaging 
        weighing 0.33 pounds. It’s a great start and going forward to create a bigger impact in the long term. </p>

      <h3>Emerging Designer of Actions</h3>
      <div class="scroll">
      <p>Earth, our very vulnerable world with finite resources. We as citizens of Earth, and our role 
         as designers have a fair responsibility for conserving energy and materials and making and 
         designing things to be durable and considerate to the environment. At both corporate and 
         individual levels, there has been better and greater emphasis on the social and environmental 
         impact of the materials and strategies designers use. As the newer generation of consumers and 
         trends become more discerning about design and more concerned with the impact of the products 
         they consume, sustainable design has a reputation of being either poor-quality, or aesthetically 
         inferior to high-end design items and expensive. As materials become scarcer, the companies become 
         more transparent and the impact of their use becomes more obvious, designers can no longer be 
         content with making a product that has better elements or is “less bad” than its competitors in 
         terms of its sustainable credentials.(4) Designers now have a real obligation to not only themselves, 
         but also future generations to introduce sustainability in every aspect of their operation, especially 
         education and training. Sustainability should be an ethos, instead of a plug-in or an add-on theme in the 
         design process. The design world has slowly grasped this idea, and the will of manufacturers to make a 
         difference to our world. Sustainability can simply start with us, designers influencing the design and 
         products, affecting or navigating both visual, products and strategies of the companies to change for 
         the better and in turn shifting the consumer’s behavior to become more socially responsible. 
         We are the facilitators in this. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="gradient">
        Imagine a world where sustainability is a core practise for the citizens of Earth. People live and 
        practise sustainability like it’s not a choice. Our preserved Earth would be a better place to live, 
        to laugh and to just exist on this green planet.</p>
